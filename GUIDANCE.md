- just about none -
- how I understand it: get the supplied front-end code TO WORK by supplying an appropriate backend
Nothing was really specified except some nonworking front-end code was supplied.
Creating models and routes to get it working seemed obvious.  Then also fixing the UI that shows total duration of the last workout
since it was also broken as-is.

what might be nice but was not assigned because EHEM NOTHING WAS exactly spelled out:
  An actual UI showing details of the last workout.  As-is, there is only a summary page but what could have been done would have been to show a more detailed list of exactly what exercises were done in the last workout.
ALSO: a way to navigate over ALL the past workout and see summaries of details.
ALSO: given that exercises are stored along with the date they were done, a calandar view with summaries in each day-cell which could be clicked on for a more detailed view would be smart.  If I was gonna take my own direction with this - I would do it that way although, of course I would prefer react for it since rich front-side stuff with a data-driven backend is exactly React's forte.  Sure, it could be gotten around awkwardly and ineffeciently with jQuery but why do that when we've got React?
